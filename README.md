# Inventory application
A inventory application to store list items. This project will be deployed using [faasd](https://github.com/openfaas/faasd) and eventually made public using [inlets pro](https://inlets.dev/). 

This repository is for learning purposes of technologies that I am interested in. I hope that through this project, I will be making use of go api, docker, ci/cd and frontend javascript using vuejs.
